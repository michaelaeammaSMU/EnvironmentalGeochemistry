# Calculation of Activity Coefficients
*In an ideal solution, activity would equal concentration.* 
### Activity and Fugacity
Activity (or fugacity for gasses), *a~i~* measures the departure of a system from ideal behavior and is related to concentration, *m~i~*, via the activity coefficient, *Î³~i~*.
This departure is cause by two main behaviours:
(1) Electrostatics interactions between charged ions,  measured by ionic strength
(2) The formation of hydration shells around ions

```{r, message=FALSE}
ionicStrength <- function(species = data.frame())
{
     IS <- is.integer(0)
     for(i in 1:nrow(species))
     {
           m <- species[i, "concentration"]
           z <- species[i, "charge"]
           output <- m * z^2
           IS <- IS + output
     }
     solutionIonicStrength <- 0.5*IS
     cat("The solution ionic strength is", solutionIonicStrength)
}

#This is where you would change the species characteristics
species <- data.frame(species = c("a", "b", "c"), 
                      concentration = c(4,2,6), 
                      charge = c(1,2,3))

ionicStrength(species)

activity <- function(y,m)
{
     a <- y*m  
}
```
